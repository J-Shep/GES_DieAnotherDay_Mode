GES_DieAnotherDay_Mode
======================
Goldeneye:Source is a free fan made remake of the N64 Goldeneye game. 

Its fans can script new modes for it using Python.

DAD mode is a remake of Mefy's MOHAA "Freeze Tag" mode, a teamplay elimination mode in which alive players can
resurrect their eliminated team mates by interacting with resurrection entities, either by standing next to them or
by firing a resurrection laser at them.

There's still a lot of work which needs to be done to finish this mode so I would appreciate any help people could
provide to help me get this mode finished as soon as possible.
